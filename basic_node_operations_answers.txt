1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.




2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and
why the specific data was outputted.



6. In this checkpoint, you encountered built-in JavaScript methods as well as the new ES6 syntax.
Review the information below before attempting the programming challenge.

Arrow Functions =>: An Alternative Way to Write Functions
//For functions with one argument
// ES5
var value = variableName.functionName(function (element) {
   return element.doSomething();
});
// ES6
var value = variableName.functionName(element => element.doSomething());

//For functions with multiple arguments or no arguments
// ES5
var value = variableName.functionName(function (a,b) {
   return a + b;
}, 0);
// ES6
var value = variableName.functionName((a, b) => a + b, 0);
Reverse String

Given a string, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while maintaining the original
word order and whitespace and return the string. To improve your problem-solving experience, use the suggested
functions to solve the problem.

Example
Input: "I'm learning to program algorithms!"
Output: "m'I gninrael ot margorp !smhtirogla"

Hint: Look at the examples above to figure out how to refactor your forEach loop to use an arrow function.

Suggested Functions

split()

stringName.split(separator)
Splits a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array. The separator specifies how to split
the string. If an empty string ('') is used as the separator (stringName.split('')) the string is split between
each character. For example, 'Hello World'.split('') -> ['H','e','l','l','o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd'].
If no separator is used, then the entire string will be returned as an array with one element.
For example, 'Hello World'.split() -> ['Hello World']. Note that the split function does not change the
original string so you must assign the result to a variable to keep the result.

forEach()

arrayName.forEach((currentItem) => {
//your iterator
})
The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.

let arr = ['I', 'study', 'at', 'Bloc'];
arr.forEach((element) => {
 console.log(element);
});
// The above code would print, 'I', 'study', 'at', 'Bloc', to the console.
push()

arrayName.push(element)
Adds new items to the end of an array and returns the new length.

reverse()

arrayName.reverse();
Reverses an array in place. The first element of the array will become the last, and the last array element
will become the first.

join()

arrayName.join(separator)
Joins all elements of an array into a string. The separator specifies a string to separate each element of
the array by. If omitted, the array elements are seperated with a comma (','). Note that the join function
does not change the original array so you must assign the result to a variable to keep the result.

let arr = ['Hello', 'World'];
arr.join(); // 'Hello,World'
arr.join(''); // 'HelloWorld'
arr.join(' '); // 'Hello World'

function reverseString(inputString) {
   //solve problem
